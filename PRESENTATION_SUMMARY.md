# Volume Monitoring Solution - Presentation Summary

## Executive Summary

### The Problem
Your payment screening system processes messages from **26 different systems** with **355 message types**, handling volumes ranging from **300 to 20 million messages per week**. The key challenge is:

- ❌ No existing volume monitoring or notification system
- ❌ Variable frequency patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual)
- ❌ Cannot use fixed thresholds due to extreme variance
- ❌ Risk of missing critical volume drops indicating system failures

### The Solution
A **dynamic, frequency-aware threshold system** that automatically:

- ✅ Detects each message type's natural frequency pattern
- ✅ Calculates appropriate thresholds using multiple statistical methods
- ✅ Generates prioritized alerts (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- ✅ Runs automatically every Monday morning
- ✅ Provides presentation-ready visualizations and reports

```

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Data Collection
```
Current State → Extract weekly volume snapshots every Monday
Format:         app, message_type, week_start_date, volume
History:        2 years of historical data
```

### 2. Frequency Detection (Automatic)
```python
Algorithm automatically detects:
- Daily:       95%+ weeks with data
- Weekly:      75-95% weeks with data
- Biweekly:    35-75% weeks with data
- Monthly:     15-35% weeks with data
- Quarterly:   5-15% weeks with data
- Semi-annual: <5% weeks with data
```

### 3. Dynamic Threshold Calculation

**Three Statistical Methods (Most Conservative Wins)**:

#### Method 1: Z-Score Based
```
Threshold = Mean - (Z × Std Dev)

Sensitivity Levels:
├─ High:   Z = 1.5 (catches smaller drops)
├─ Medium: Z = 2.0 (recommended)
└─ Low:    Z = 2.5 (only major drops)
```

#### Method 2: Percentile Based
```
Threshold = Xth percentile of historical volumes

Sensitivity Levels:
├─ High:   10th percentile
├─ Medium:  5th percentile
└─ Low:     2nd percentile
```

#### Method 3: IQR (Interquartile Range)
```
Threshold = Q1 - (1.5 × IQR)
└─ Robust to outliers
```

**Final Threshold = MAX(Method1, Method2, Method3)**

### 4. Alert Generation

```
Volume Drop Severity:
├─ CRITICAL: ≥70% drop or NO DATA → Immediate action
├─ HIGH:     50-69% drop → Urgent review
├─ MEDIUM:   30-49% drop → Review within 24 hours
└─ LOW:      <30% drop → Monitor
```

## Sample Results (Latest Week Analysis)

### Week: October 20, 2025 | Sensitivity: Medium

```
Total Alerts:        50

By Severity:
├─ HIGH:            23 alerts  (Urgent attention required)
├─ MEDIUM:           8 alerts  (Review needed)
└─ LOW:             19 alerts  (Monitor)
```

### Example HIGH Priority Alert

```
App: APP_01
Message Type: MT924
Current Volume:       2,167,569
Expected Mean:       10,000,000
Alert Threshold:      7,473,483
Recent 4-Week Avg:    9,800,000

Drop: 77.4% below mean

⚠️ Action: Immediate investigation required

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
```
Implementation:     1 week (40 hours)
Weekly monitoring:  2 hours/week
Infrastructure:     Minimal (cron + email)
Total Year 1:       ~$15,000 (labor + infrastructure)
```

### Benefits
```
Early detection:           Prevent system failures
Proactive monitoring:      Reduce downtime
Data-driven decisions:     Capacity planning
Compliance:                Audit trail for volumes
ROI:                       Positive within 3 months
```

**Conservative estimate**: Catching just **one critical system failure** that would have taken 4 hours to detect manually justifies the entire investment.

## Questions & Answers

### Q: How do we handle seasonal variations?
**A**: The rolling threshold calculation automatically adapts to trends. For known seasonal patterns, we can add seasonal adjustment factors.

### Q: What if a message type is new (< 2 years of data)?
**A**: System requires minimum weeks of data (default 6). New message types are monitored but alerts only start after sufficient history.

### Q: Can we set custom thresholds for specific critical message types?
**A**: Yes! You can override thresholds in the configuration file for any app-message combination.

### Q: How do we reduce false positives?
**A**: Three approaches:
1. Lower sensitivity (medium → low)
2. Increase minimum weeks required
3. Add business context (holiday calendars, maintenance windows)

### Q: What about real-time monitoring (not just weekly)?
**A**: Current solution is weekly (matches your extraction). Can be adapted to daily or hourly with same logic.

### Q: How do we integrate with existing systems?
**A**: JSON output format allows easy integration with:
- Email systems (SMTP)
- Slack/Teams (webhooks)
- Dashboards (PowerBI, Tableau)
- Incident management (ServiceNow, Jira)
